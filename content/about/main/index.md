  Hey there! I'm Aris. I recently graduated with a BS in Computational Biology
  from Brown University and have taken a role as a bioinformatician at the
  [Bailey Lab](http://www.baileylab.org/) at Brown. I currently work on
  developing software to study the genetics and genomics of infectious disease
  and immunity.
  
  Besides infectious diseases, my interests include medicine and data anlytics.
  I am particularly interested in leveraging data analytics to inform
  local-decision making by physicians and showcasing the effect of more holistic
  and personalized treatment.
