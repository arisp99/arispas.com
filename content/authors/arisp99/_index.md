I am a second-year medical student at the UMass Chan Medical School. I am
interested in combining clinical practice and academic medicine to transform
medicine, inform local-decision making by physicians, and homogenize care by
leveraging computational techniques.

Previously, I worked as a bioinformatician at the [Bailey
Lab](http://www.baileylab.org/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I
primarily worked on developing software to study the genetics and genomics of
infectious disease and immunity.
