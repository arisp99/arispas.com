# Abstract and optional shortened version
abstract: "In malaria, individuals are often infected with different parasite
strains; the complexity of infection (COI) is defined as the number of
genetically distinct parasite strains in an individual. Changes in the mean COI
in a population have been shown to be informative of changes in transmission
intensity with a number of probabilistic likelihood and Bayesian models now
developed to estimate the COI. However, rapid, direct measures based on
heterozygosity or FwS do not properly represent the COI. In this work, we
present two new methods that use easily calculated measures to directly estimate
the COI from allele frequency data. Using a simulation framework, we show that
our methods are computationally efficient and comparably accurate to current
methods in the literature. Through a sensitivity analysis, we characterize how
the bias and accuracy of our two methods are impacted by the distribution of
parasite densities and the assumed sequencing depth and number of sampled loci.
We further estimate the COI globally from Plasmodium falciparum sequencing data
using our developed methods and compare the results against the literature. We
show significant differences in estimated COI globally between continents and a
weak relationship between malaria prevalence and COI."
