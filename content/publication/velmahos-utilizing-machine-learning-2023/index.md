abstract: "
**Background:**
Complex machine learning (ML) models have revolutionized predictions in clinical
care. However, for laparoscopic colectomy (LC), prediction of morbidity by ML
has not been adequately analyzed nor compared against traditional logistic
regression (LR) models.\n\n
**Methods:**
All LC patients, between 2017 and 2019, in the National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program (NSQIP) were identified. A composite outcome of 17 variables
defined any post-operative morbidity. Seven of the most common complications
were additionally analyzed. Three ML models (Random Forests, XGBoost, and
L1-L2-RFE) were compared with LR.\n\n
**Results:**
Random Forests, XGBoost, and L1-L2-RFE predicted 30-day post-operative morbidity
with average area under the curve (AUC): .709, .712, and .712, respectively. LR
predicted morbidity with AUC = .712. Septic shock was predicted with AUC â‰¤ .9,
by ML and LR.\n\n
**Conclusion:**
There was negligible difference in the predictive ability of ML and LR in
post-LC morbidity prediction. Possibly, the computational power of ML cannot be
realized in limited datasets."
