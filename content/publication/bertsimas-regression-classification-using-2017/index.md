# Abstract and optional shortened version
abstract: "Current state-of-the-art decision tree algorithms, such as
Classification and Regression Trees (CART), build the decision tree using a
recursive approach based on a greedy heuristic. We study the benefits of an
optimal decision tree approach, which creates the entire decision tree at once
using Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO). While such problems are known to be hard
to solve for large instances, we leverage modern solver techniques that are able
to obtain near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. The methodology
is able to handle both single-feature splits, as in CART, and also hyperplane
splits that use multiple features. We test optimal regression trees on a host of
synthetic datasets and optimal classification tress on a novel application
concerning the usage of CT imagining to diagnose head injuries in children. Our
results demonstrate that optimal trees lead to a significantly greater accuracy
than CART."
