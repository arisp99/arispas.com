**Background:**
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provide the patientâ€™s perspective
following total hip arthroplasty (THA), although differences between primary THA
(pTHA) and revision THA (rTHA) remain unclear. Thus, we compared the Minimal
Clinically Important Difference for Improvement (MCID-I) and Worsening (MCID-W)
in pTHA and rTHA patients.\n\n
**Methods:**
Data from 2,159 patients (1,995 pTHAs/164 rTHAs) who had completed Hip
Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form
(HOOS-PS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
Physical Function Short Form 10a (PF10a), PROMIS Global-Mental, or PROMIS
Global-Physical questionnaires were analyzed. The PROMs and MCID-I/MCID-W rates
were compared using statistical tests and multivariate logistic regressions.\n\n
**Results:**
Compared to the pTHA group, the rTHA group had lower rates of improvement and
higher rates of worsening for almost all PROMs, including HOOS-PS (MCID-I: 54
vs. 84%, P<0.001; MCID-W: 24 vs. 4.4%, P<0.001), PF10a (MCID-I: 44 vs. 73%,
P<0.001; MCID-W: 22 vs. 5.9%, P<0.001), PROMIS Global-Mental (MCID-W: 42 vs.
28%, P<0.001), and PROMIS Global-Physical (MCID-I: 41 vs. 68%, P<0.001; MCID-W:
26 vs. 11%, P<0.001). Odds ratios supported rates of worsening following
revision for the HOOS-PS (Odds Ratio (OR): 8.25, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):
5.62-12.4, P<0.001), PF10a (OR: 8.34, 95% CI: 5.63-12.6, P<0.001), PROMIS
Global-Mental (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.41-3.34, P<0.001), and PROMIS Global-Physical
(OR: 3.69, 95% CI: 2.46-5.62, P<0.001).\n\n
**Conclusion:**
Patients reported higher rates of worsening and lower rates of improvement
following rTHA than pTHA, with significantly less score improvement and lower
postoperative scores for all PROMs after revision. Most patients reported
improvements following pTHA, with few worsening postoperatively."
