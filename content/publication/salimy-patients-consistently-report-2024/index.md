**Background:**
Differences in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between primary TKA
(pTKA) and revision TKA (rTKA) have not been well-studied. Therefore, we
compared pTKA and rTKA patients by the rates of achieving the Minimal Clinically
Important Difference for Improvement (MCID-I) and Worsening (MCID-W).\n\n
**Methods:**
A total of 2,448 patients (2,239 pTKAs/209 rTKAs) were retrospectively studied.
Patients who completed the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical
Function Short Form (KOOS-PS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System (PROMIS) Physical Function Short Form 10a (PF10a), PROMIS Global-Mental,
or PROMIS Global-Physical questionnaires were identified by Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) codes. Patient-reported outcome measures and MCID-I/MCID-W
rates were compared. Multivariate logistic regression models measured
relationships between surgery type and postoperative outcomes.\n\n
**Results:**
Patients who underwent rTKA (all causes) had lower rates of improvement and
higher rates of worsening compared to pTKA patients for KOOS-PS (MCID-I: 54 vs.
68%, P<0.001; MCID-W: 18 vs. 8.6%, P<0.001), PF10a (MCID-I: 44 vs. 65%, P<0.001;
MCID-W: 22 vs. 11%, P<0.001), PROMIS Global-Mental (MCID-I: 34 vs. 45%,
P=0.005), and PROMIS Global-Physical (MCID-I: 51 vs. 60%, P=0.014; MCID-W: 29
vs. 14%, P<0.001). Undergoing revision was predictive of worsening
postoperatively for KOOS-PS, PF10a, and PROMIS Global-Physical compared to pTKA.
Postoperative scores were significantly higher for all four PROMs following
pTKA.\n\n
**Conclusion:**
Patients reported significantly less improvement and higher rates of worsening
following rTKA, particularly for PROMs that assessed physical function. Although
pTKA patients did better overall, the improvement rates may be considered
relatively low and should prompt discussions on improving outcomes following
pTKA and rTKA."
