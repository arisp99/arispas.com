**Introduction:**
The effect of mental health on patient-reported outcome measures is not fully
understood in total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Thus, we investigated the
relationship between mental health diagnoses (MHDs) and the Minimal Clinically
Important Difference for Improvement (MCID-I) and Worsening (MCID-W) in primary
TJA and revision TJA (rTJA).\n\n
**Methods:**
Retrospective data were collected using relevant Current Procedural Terminology
and MHDs International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes with
completed Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function
Short Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short
Form, Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Physical
Function Short Form 10a, PROMIS Global-Mental, or PROMIS Global-Physical
questionnaires. Logistic regressions and statistical analyses were used to
determine the effect of a MHD on MCID-I/MCID-W rates.\n\n
**Results:**
Data included 4,562 patients (4,190 primary TJAs/372 rTJAs). In primary total
hip arthroplasty (pTHA), MHD-affected outcomes for Hip Disability and
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form (MCID-I: 81% versus
86%, P = 0.007; MCID-W: 6.0% versus 3.2%, P = 0.008), Physical Function Short
Form 10a (MCID-I: 68% versus 77%, P < 0.001), PROMIS Global-Mental (MCID-I: 38%
versus 44%, P = 0.009), and PROMIS Global-Physical (MCID-I: 61% versus 73%, P <
0.001; MCID-W: 14% versus 7.9%, P < 0.001) versus pTHA patients without MHD. A
MHD led to lower rates of MCID-I for PROMIS Global-Physical (MCID-I: 56% versus
63%, P = 0.003) in primary total knee arthroplasty patients. No effects from a
MHD were observed in rTJA patients.\n\n
**Discussion:**
The presence of a MHD had a prominent negative influence on pTHA patients.
Patients who underwent rTJA had lower MCID-I rates, higher MCID-W rates, and
lower patient-reported outcome measure scores despite less influence from a
MHD."
