  abstract = {Introduction:~           The effect of mental health on patient-reported outcome measures is not fully understood in total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Thus, we investigated the relationship between mental health diagnoses (MHDs) and the Minimal Clinically Important Difference for Improvement (MCID-I) and Worsening (MCID-W) in primary TJA and revision TJA (rTJA).           Methods:~           Retrospective data were collected using relevant Current Procedural Terminology and MHDs International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes with completed Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form, Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Physical Function Short Form 10a, PROMIS Global-Mental, or PROMIS Global-Physical questionnaires. Logistic regressions and statistical analyses were used to determine the effect of a MHD on MCID-I/MCID-W rates.           Results:~           Data included 4,562 patients (4,190 primary TJAs/372 rTJAs). In primary total hip arthroplasty (pTHA), MHD-affected outcomes for Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form (MCID-I: 81\% versus 86\%, P = 0.007; MCID-W: 6.0\% versus 3.2\%, P = 0.008), Physical Function Short Form 10a (MCID-I: 68\% versus 77\%, P {$<$} 0.001), PROMIS Global-Mental (MCID-I: 38\% versus 44\%, P = 0.009), and PROMIS Global-Physical (MCID-I: 61\% versus 73\%, P {$<$} 0.001; MCID-W: 14\% versus 7.9\%, P {$<$} 0.001) versus pTHA patients without MHD. A MHD led to lower rates of MCID-I for PROMIS Global-Physical (MCID-I: 56\% versus 63\%, P = 0.003) in primary total knee arthroplasty patients. No effects from a MHD were observed in rTJA patients.           Discussion:~           The presence of a MHD had a prominent negative influence on pTHA patients. Patients who underwent rTJA had lower MCID-I rates, higher MCID-W rates, and lower patient-reported outcome measure scores despite less influence from a MHD.           Level of evidence:~           Level III, retrospective comparative study.},
