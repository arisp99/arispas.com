Malaria remains a leading cause of death worldwideâ€”in 2020, there were an
estimated 241 million cases and 627,000 deaths around the globe
[@organization_world_2021]. Despite the considerable burden of malaria, these
numbers represent substantial progress that has been made globally to control
malaria in the last two decades. However, there is evidence that progress has
slowed and that there is a need for new approaches to capitalize on the gains
made [@organization_world_2020].

One approach is the use of computational methods to help inform eradication
efforts, which often rely on recent advances in genetic sequencing and an
increased understanding of malaria biology [@andrade_towards_2010;
@band_insights_2019; @timmann_genome-wide_2012]. While determining the exact
metrics that are most informative is an active field of investigation
[@watson_evaluating_2021], one important metric is the complexity of infection
(COI). The COI represents the number of genetically distinct malaria genomes or
strains that can be identified in a particular individual and has been
increasingly used for inferring malaria transmission intensity and evaluating
malaria control interventions [@daniels_modeling_2015].

Using our newly developed software package,
[coiaf](https://arispas.com/project/coiaf/), we analysed samples from the
MalariaGEN _Plasmodium falciparum_ Community Project [@malariagen_open_2021].
The MalariaGEN _Plasmodium falciparum_ Community Project provides genomic data
from over 7,000 _P. falciparum_ samples from 28 malaria-endemic countries in
Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania from 2002-2015. Detailed information
about the data release including brief descriptions of contributing partner
studies and study locations is available in the supplementary of MalariaGEN _et
al_.
